# Prisoner's Dilema Simulation

This python script contains a Prisoner's Dilemma function that returns either hawk, 'h' or dove 'd'. This function was used in a competition and my strategy consisted of attempy to play cooperatively by playing 'd', if falling behind, play 'h'. Otherwise play 'd'. On the final round two rounds, play 'h' to get the lead.
